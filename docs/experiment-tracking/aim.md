##Â Experiment Tracking with Aim

This was more or less a copy paste of the tracker written for MLFlow available here.

The one caveat is that their implementation did not support multi-gpu training.
That required a step to use 'comm' in order to check whether the process in which the code was being run was the 'main' process. Without this check an experiment was tracked 
for every GPU being used to run training e.g. you run python train.py and get an experiment for each GPU.

    Looking at write_metrics in this file can help with further development.
