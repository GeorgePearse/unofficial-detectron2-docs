## Motivation

The detectron2 API is incredible, but the documentation and response to GitHub issues are incredibly bad. 

This is very wasteful, and felt like an easy thing to start fixing. 

Between a lot of different GitHub issues and Stack discussions, a lot of the problems contained here were already solved, but a lot of time had to be put into searching Google in order to find those, parse what you cared about and implement the solutions. This is meant to be a one stop shop.

(Note I'd love to upstream this content to the original Detectron2 docs if they'd allow it, but for the timebeing this will do)
